    <h1>Lesson 1.1 The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
    <div class="concepts">
      <h2>My intentions</h2>
      <p>
        <i>I intend to learn quickly and I am determined to work on the projects with the right determination and commitment.</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Some sidenotes beforehand</h2>
      <p>
        Most stuff
        <br>About HTML
        <br>I already know
        <br>However I have plenty to learn and
        <br> <u>Practice</u> in particular
      </p>

      <h2>First findings!</h2>

      <p>
        <em>Apparently writing stuff in ""em" tags does the same as </em> <i>writing stuff in "i" tags</i>
        <br> I have found some very interesting <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language">links</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Final remarks for I begin</h2>

      <p>
        All in all I hope to be a happy coder in time :)

    <h1>Lesson 1.2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1>
    <div class="concepts">

      <h2>Languages</h2>

      <p>
        The three most important languages in front-end developing are HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML is like the structure of the house and the CSS is like the style of the house.
      </p>

      <h2>Elements</h2>

      <p>
        All elements on the page are rectangular and all text that is shown on the page can be found in the elements, deep down.
      </p>

      <h2>Tree structure of a page</h2>

      <p>
        Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag Inside a div-element can be a h2 element within there can be a span element containing text. Also within that div element can be a p element containing text and a elements
      </p>

      <h2>Boxes</h2>

      <p>Every element on the page is a box, although it can manifest itself in another form.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 1.3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h1>
    <div class="concepts">

      <h2>What does cascading or sheets mean?</h2>

      <p>
        CSS will be referenced in HTML. The rules can be compared to the different levels of law: national law state law, municipality law, house rules.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Benefits of avoiding repetition</h2>
      
      <p>
        One example of the "national law" in CSS and HTML is this webpage is the
        div class called "lesson". Since all the boxes that cover a lesson are
        given this class-name, they can all be referred to the same tag in CSS
        (called .lesson).This way the styling specifications for all the
        different lesson boxes don't have to be written out multiple times.
        This allows the programmer to work faster and for changing the code
        faster later in the process. The same goes for the "state law" in this
        webpage, which is the div class called "concepts".
